{"name":"TouchDesigner to FadeCandy","tagline":"Touch Designer to Fade Candy App using Spout and Cinder","body":"### TouchDesigner to FadeCandy\r\nThis repo consists of a C++ app and sample Touch Designer 088 file for sending TOP data from Touch to a [FadeCandy](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy) LED controller. \r\n\r\n[![Led Portal](http://img.youtube.com/vi/nPB034gUK3I/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPB034gUK3I)\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2013 solution file provided. Requires Touch Designer 088 25220 or later, the [Cinder-Asio](https://github.com/BanTheRewind/Cinder-Asio) block, the [FadeCandyCinderClient](https://github.com/jhurlbut/FadeCandyCinderClient) block, and the 0.8.6 tag of [Cinder](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder)\r\n\r\nTo run start the fc server, the cinder app and the touch designer file. \r\n\r\n### Touch Sample\r\nThe sample TouchDesigner file is from a Halloween LED Portal I made using five 8x8 led grids from ada electronics along with a single 64 led strip. There are a few different effects and a simple simulator. \r\n\r\n### Cinder Sample\r\nThe Cinder Sample code creates a Spout receiver and runs a custom effect routine to map the incoming TOP to Fadecandy. This code could also be used to send textures back and forth between Touch Designer and a Cinder application for processing.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
