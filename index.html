<p>This repo consists of a C++ app and sample Touch Designer 088 file for sending TOP data from Touch to a <a href="https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy">FadeCandy</a> LED controller. </p>

<p>You will need to run the fc server, the cinder app and the touch designer file. </p>

<a id="touch-sample" class="anchor" href="#touch-sample" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Touch Sample</h3>

<p>The sample TouchDesigner file is from a Halloween LED Portal I made using five 8x8 led grids from ada electronics along with a single 64 led strip. There are a few different effects and a simple simulator. </p>

<h3>
<a id="cinder-sample" class="anchor" href="#cinder-sample" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cinder Sample</h3>

<p>The Cinder Sample code creates a Spout receiver and runs a custom effect routine to map the incoming TOP to Fadecandy. </p>
